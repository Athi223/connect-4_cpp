# Connect 4
A simple Connect 4 game using C++

PS. On Windows You'll need **Windows Terminal** to view the Colored disks as CMD/PS don't support emojis. Else you can replace the UTF-8 Hex emojis `src/main.cpp` Line no. `26` and `36`, `src/board.cpp` Line no. `42` and `45` with some characters (say X and O) and play the game.
